## Moodle Manual  Migration
This document explains how to migrate Moodle from OnPrem servers to Azure cloud.
## Option 2: Moodle Migration without ARM Template

 * Migration of Moodle with out ARM Template is to create the infrastructure manually in Azure and migrate Moodle on it. 
 * The Azure infrastructure is the basic skeleton of the resources which will host the Moodle application.
 

## Prerequisites
- If the predefined templates does not match with on-prem configuration then on-prem Moodle has to be upgraded to more recent versions.
- Must have access to the OnPrem servers to take backup of Moodle and database/configurations.
- Should have a Azure subscription and the Azure Blob storage created before migration.
- Azure cli should be installed in onprem to use AZCOPY
- This migration activity supports with the following Softwares.
    - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
    - Nginx web server 1.10.3
    - Apache2 2.4
    - MySQL PaaS 5.6, 5.7 or 8.0 database server
    - PHP 7.2, 7.3, or 7.4
    - Moodle 3.8 & 3.9

## Migration Approach
- Migration of Moodle application has 3 phases
    - Pre Migration
    - Migration
    - Post Migration

Following operations are performed in the process of Migration.

- **Pre Migration**
    - Data Export from OnPrem to Azure Cloud
        - Create Subscription
        - Install Azure CLI
        - Create Resource Group
        - Create Storage Account
        - Backup of on-prem data
        - Copy Archive file to Blob storage

- **Migration**
    - Migration of Moodle
        - Install prerequisites for Moodle
        - Create Moodle Shared folder
        - Download on-prem archive file
        - Download and run the migrate_moodle.sh script
        - Configuring permissions
        - Importing Database
        - Configuring Php & WebServer
        - Configuring VMSS
        - Set a cron job

- **Post Migration**
    - Update log paths
    - Updating Cron Job 
    - Configuring certs
    - Restarting servers

## Pre Migration
- **Data Export from OnPrem to Azure Cloud:**
    - **Create Subscription:**
        - User must have Azure subscription to create a blob storage.
        - Select existing subscription or user can add a subscription [click here](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade), can select [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/offers/ms-azr-0003p/).
    - **Install Azure CLI** 
        - Install Azure CLI to copy the onprem data to cloud.
            - Install Azure CLI 
                ```
                curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
                ```
        - Now login into your Azure account
            ```
                az login
            ```
        - If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.
        - Otherwise, open a browser page at https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the authorization code displayed in your terminal.
        - Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.
        - Sign in with credentials on the command line
            ```
                az login -u <username> -p <password>
            ```
    - **Create Resource Group:**
        - After creating the subscription, create a [Resource Group](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ResourceGroup).
            ```
                # cmd to create a RG
                az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file <path-to-template>
            ```
    - **Create Storage Account:**
        - Create Azure Storage Account in the same Resource Group 
            - Create a [storage account](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount) with AutoKind value as "BlobStorage"
            ```
                # cmd to create a Storage account
                
            ```
            - Give the storage account name must be in combination of lowercase and numericals, click on create button as shown above.
            - Storage Account is created, can be used to store the onprem data.
    - **Backup of on-prem data:**
        - Take backup of onprem data such as moodle, moodledata, configurations and database backup file to a folder
        - Moodle and Moodledata
            - Moodle folder consists of site HTML content and Moodledata contains Moodle site data
        - Configurations
            - Copy the php configurations files such as php-fpm.conf, php.ini, pool.d and conf.d folder to phpconfig folder under the configuration folder.
            - copy the ngnix or apache configuration such as nginx.conf, sites-enabled/dns.conf to the nginxconfig folder under the configuration folder
        - create a backup of database 
            - Before taking backup of database onprem should have mysql-server to be installed.
                ```
                    sudo -s
                    sudo apt install mysql-server
                    mysql -u dbUserName -p
                    # After the above command user will prompted for database password
                    mysqldump -h dbServerName -u dbUserId -pdbPassword dbName > /path/to/location/database.sql
                    # Replace dbServerName, dbUserId, dbPassword and bdName with onPrem database details
                ```
        - Create an archive tar.gz file of backup folder
            ```
                tar -zcvf moodle.tar.gz <source/folder/name>
            ```
    - **Copy Archive file to Blob storage**
        - Copy the onprem archive file to blob storage by following command.
            - To copy use AzCopy user should generate SAS Token.
            - Go to the created Storage Account Resource and navigate to Shared access signature in the left pannel.
            - Select the Container checkbox and set the start, expiry date of the SAS token. Click on "Generate SAS and Connection String". 
            - copy the SAS token for further use.
                ```
                    az storage container create --account-name <storageAccontName> --name <containerName> --sas-token <SAS_token>
                    sudo azcopy copy '/path/to/location/moodle.tar' 'https://<storageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<containerName>/<dns>/<SAStoken>
                ```
            - With the above steps onprem compressed data is exported to Azure blob storage.
            

## Migration
    
- **Migration of Moodle**
    - **Creating Resources**
        - Import the data from Azure blob storage to VM to migrate.
        * For installing the infrastructure for Moodle navigate to the [azure portal](portal.azure.com) 
        * In the home section go the resource group section and add a new a resource group for the Moodle infrastructure [click here](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups) 000
        * Select the created subscription, give the resource group name and select the region for deployment.
            ```
                # Command to create a RG
            ```
        * Note: The subscription and region will be same for all the resources created under the deployment.
        * Add the tag for more specification 
        * Tags are name-value pairs that are used to organize resources in Azure Portal [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources) 
        * Click on review and create for creating a resource group 
        * Once resource group is created navigate to it and start create resources under it. 

- ##### Creating Resources to host the Moodle application 
- **Network Resources**
    * **Load Balancer:**  An Azure load balancer is a Layer-4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that provides high availability by distributing incoming traffic among healthy VMs. A load balancer health probe monitors a given port on each VM and only distributes traffic to an operational VM. [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/tutorial-load-balancer-standard-internal-portal) 
        ```
            #command to deploy load balancer
        ```
    *  In the Basics tab, Select the same subscription and same resource created in above step, give the instance details such as name for load balancer, and default region. 
    *  Select the type as public and sku as standard. 
       -  A public load balancer can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your virtual network. These connections are accomplished by translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses. Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs.
       - Standard tier can scale out to 1000 instances and Standard tier can scale out to 1000 instances 
    *  For Public IP address section ,Create a new IP address and give the IP address name and keep other parameters as default.
    *  Click next to tag section, if required give the tag value for more clarification. 
    *  After giving the mandatory values click on review and create. 

    - **Virtual Network** - An Azure Virtual Network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. When you create a VNet, your services and VMs within your VNet can communicate directly and securely with each other in the cloud. More information on Virtual Network [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview). 
        ```
            #command to create virtual network
        ```
    - Navigate to the resource group, select Create a resource. From the Azure Marketplace, select Networking > Virtual network.
    - In Create virtual network, for Basics section provide this information: 
        - Subscription: Select the same subscription. 
        - Resource Group: Select same resource group. 
        - Name: Give the instance name. 
        - Region: Select default region. 
    - Select Next: IP Addresses, and for IPv4 address space, enter 10.1.0.0/16. 
    - Select Add subnet, then enter Subnet name and 10.1.0.0/24 for Subnet address range.
        ```
            #command to create subnet
        ```

    - Select Add, then select Review + create. Leave the rest parameters as default and select Create.

    - **Azure Application GateWay** - An Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port. For more information [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview).
        - To deploy the Application gate way from Azure Portal [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/quick-create-portal).
        - To deploy the Application gate way from Azure CLI [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/quick-create-cli)
    
- **Storage Resources**
    * An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS
    * Storage account will have specific type, replication, Performance, Size.Below are some examples. [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).
     *  The types of storage accounts are:
        - General-purpose V2- It is Basic storage account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables and recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage
        - General-purpose V1- It is Legacy account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables somecan can use  general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.
        - BlockBlobStorage- Storage accounts with premium performance characteristics for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for scenarios with high transactions rates, or scenarios that use smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency.
        - File Storage- Files-only storage accounts with premium performance characteristics. Recommended for enterprise or high performance scale applications.
        - BlobStorage accounts- Legacy Blob-only storage accounts. Use general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.
    - Replication:
        - Locally-redundant storage (LRS)- A simple, low-cost redundancy strategy. Data is copied synchronously three times within the primary region.
        - Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)-  Redundancy for scenarios requiring high availability. Data is copied synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.
        - Geo redundant storage (GRS)- Cross-regional redundancy to protect against regional outages. Data is copied synchronously three times in the primary region, then copied asynchronously to the secondary region. For read access to data in the secondary region, enable read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS).
    - Performance: 
        - Standard- A standard performance tier for storing blobs, files, tables, queues, and Azure virtual machine disks.
        - Premium- A premium performance tier for storing unmanaged virtual machine disks.
    - Size(sku):  A single storage account can store up to 500 TB of data and like any other Azure service
    - For creating a storage account navigate to the resource group and search resource storage account.
    - On the Storage Accounts window that appears, choose Add. 
    - Select the default subscription in which to create the storage account. 
    - Under the Resource group field, select the default resource group 
    - Next, give the name for  storage account. The name you choose must be unique across Azure. The name also must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, can include numbers and lowercase letters only. 
    - Select a default region for storage account.
    - Keep the Deployment model default as Resource Manager 
    - Choose the performance as standard or premium 
    - Choose the Acount kind as per choice such as General-purpose V1 or General-purpose V2 
    - Choose any of the replication such as LRS,GRS,etc.
    - Choose the access tier for the same
    - Azure storage offers different access tiers, which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include: Hot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently. Cool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days
    - Leave the others tabs as default.
    - Select Review + Create to review your storage account settings and create the account.Select Create. [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)
    - For more information about types of storage accounts and other storage account settings, see [Azure storage account overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview). For more information on resource groups, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview). 
    - For NFS and glusterFS:  
        - Replication is standard Locally-redundant storage (LRS)  
        - Type is Storage (general purpose v1) 
    - Azure Files: 
        - Replication is Premium Locally-redundant storage (LRS)  
        - Type is File Storage  
    - These storage mechanisms will differ according to storage type such as 
        - NFS and glusterFS will create a container 
        - Azure files will create a file share. 
    - To access the containers and file share etc. navigate to storage account in resource group in the portal. 
    
        ```
            #command to deploy storage account
        ```

            ```
 
- **Scale Set:** 
    - A virtual machine scale set allows you to deploy and manage a set of auto-scaling virtual machines. You can scale the number of VMs in the scale set manually or define rules to auto scale based on resource usage like CPU, memory demand, or network traffic. An Azure load balancer then distributes traffic to the VM instances in the scale set. For more information [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/quick-create-portal).
    - Create a scale set in same resource group.
    - Prerequisites is the to create a public Standard Load Balancer.
        - User can create Azure Application Gateway. For more information [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview).
    - The name and public IP address created are automatically configured as the load balancer's front end. 
        - Scale set creates an VM instance with Ubuntu 16.04 OS.
        - Search Virtual machine scale sets. Select Create on the Virtual machine scale sets page, which will open the Create a virtual machine scale set page. 
        - In the Basics tab, under Project details, select the subscription and then choose to same resource. 
        - Type name as the name for your scale set. 
        - In Region, select the same region. 
        - Leave the default value of Scale Set VMs for Orchestration mode. 
        - Enter your desired username, and select which authentication type as SSH and give the same SSH key and username as azureadmin.
        - Select the image or browse the image for the scale set 
        - Select the size for the disk. 
        - Select the authentication type as SSH and provide the same username as azureadmin and SSH key 
        - Click Next for the disk tab select the OS disk type as per choice 
        - Click Next for the networking section
        - Select the created virtual network.
        - Give the instance count and the scaling policy as manual or custom.
            - set the rules to scale up/down a VM based on the average cpu percentage.
        - Select Next and keep the other things as default. 
        - Click on review and create and the scale set. 

    - Scale set can be created from Azure CLI
        ```
            # Command for creating Scale Set
        ```
    - VMSS will create a VM instance with an internal IP. User need to have a VPN gateway to access the VM. 
    - To setup the Virtual Network Gateway please read the [document](GitHub Link to be provided).

    - **Configuring VMSS**

                ```
        - **Mounting File Share**
            - Mount Azure File share in VM instance 
                - Follow the [documentation](GitHub document link for mounting AF Share) to set the Azure File Share on VMSS
                - If user want to set the File Server as NFS follow the [docs](link for mounting nfs).
       
        - **Configuring Php & WebServer**
            - Download the configuration.tar.gz from the blob storage.
            - The path to download will be /home/azureadmin
                ```
                    cd /home/azureadmin 
                    azcopy copy 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/BlobDirectory/*' 'Path/to/folder' 
                ```
            - Extract configuration.tar.gz file
                ```
                    tar -zxvf yourfile.tar.gz
                ```
            - The configuration folder will be extracted with nginx and php configuration files.
            - First change the database details in moodle configuration file (/moodle/config.php)
                ```
                    mkdir  -p /home/azureadmin/backup/
                    sudo mv /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<dns>.conf  /home/azureadmin/backup/ 
                    cd /home/azureadmin/storage/configuration/
                    sudo cp <dns>.conf  /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ 
                ```
                Note: Update the following parameters in config.php
                    - dbhost, dbname, dbuser, dbpass, dataroot and wwwroot.
            - copy the php config file from blob storage to the php config folder. 
                ```
                    sudo mv /etc/php/<phpVersion>/fpm/pool.d/www.conf /home/azureadmin/backup 
                    sudo  cp /home/azureadmin/storage/configuration/www.conf /etc/php/<phpVersion>/fpm/pool.d/ 
                    sudo systemctl restart nginx 
                    sudo systemctl restart php(phpVersion)-fpm  
                    ex: sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm  
                ```

    - **Set a cron job** 
        - VMSS will have a local copy of the moodle shared content to /var/www/html/
        - Whenever there is a change in shared folder a file with time stamp will get updated.
        - Cron job will look for the change in time stamp for every minute. 
        - If the change is identified by the Cron job, It will copy the shared folder to /var/www/html/

        - *Download and run setup_cron.sh:*
            - setup_cron.sh has set of commands which will set the cron job to create a local copy of shared folder in VMSS.
                ```
                    sudo -s
                    cd /home/azureadmin/
                    wget <git raw link for setup_cron.sh>
                    bash setup_cron.sh
                ```
        Note: nginx configuration will point root directory as /var/www/html/ in the instance
    - **Restart Servers**
        - Restart nginx server & php-fpm server
            ```
                sudo systemctl restart nginx 
                sudo systemctl restart php(phpVersion)-fpm  
            ```
        - With the above steps Moodle infrastructure is ready 
        - User now hit the load balancer DNS name to get the migrated moodle web page. 
    
## Post Migration
    -   Post migration of Moodle application user need to update the certs and log paths as follows
    
- **Virtual Machine:**
    - **Log Paths**               
        - On-prem might be having different log path location and those paths need to be updated with Azure log paths.
        - Log path are defaulted to /var/log/nginx.
             - access.log and error.log are created.
        
    - **Certs:**
        - *SSL Certs*: The certificates for your Moodle application reside in /moodle/certs/
        
        - Copy over the .crt and .key files over to /moodle/certs/. The file names should be changed to nginx.crt and nginx.key in order to be recognized by the configured nginx servers. Depending on your local environment, you may choose to use the utility scp or a tool like WinSCP to copy these files over to the cluster controller virtual machine.

        - You can also generate a self-signed certificate, useful for testing only:
            ```
                openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
                -keyout /moodle/certs/nginx.key \
                -out /moodle/certs/nginx.crt \
                -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/L=Redmond/O=IT/CN=mydomain.com"
            ```
        - It's recommended that the certificate files be read-only to owner and that these files are owned by www-data:
            ```
                chown www-data:www-data /moodle/certs/nginx.*
                chmod 400 /moodle/certs/nginx.*
            ```
    - **Restart servers**
        - Update the time stap to update the local copy in VMSS instance.
        - Restart the nginx and php-fpm servers
            ```
                sudo systemctl restart nginx
                sudo systemctl restart php<phpVersion>-fpm
            ```


- **Virtual Machine Scale Set:**
    - **Log Paths**               
        - On-prem might be having different log path location and those paths need to be updated with Azure log paths.
        - Log path are defaulted to /var/log/nginx.
             - access.log and error.log are created

    - **Restart servers**
        - Update the time stap to update the local copy in VMSS instance.
        - Restart the nginx and php-fpm servers
            ```
                sudo systemctl restart nginx
                sudo systemctl restart php<phpVersion>-fpm
            ```
